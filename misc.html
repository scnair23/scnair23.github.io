        Some bits about myself.

            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>
                I have a keen interest in everything related to football (or soccer). I grew up admiring Wayne Rooney and naturally, my 
                football allegiances (albeit despondent) lie with Manchester United. Some of my fondest memories spring from my time at 
                IIT Kanpur playing football and FIFA with friends. <a href="footypics.html">Here</a> are some pictures.
